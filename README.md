## DSA-Project-Documentation
This portfolio showcases practical data analysis projects developed during my journey to becoming a certified data analyst at the Incubator Hub, Lagos. 
The projects showcased here demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and storytelling, utilizing tools such as Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI. 
Each project tackles real-world scenarios and emphasizes data-driven insights for decision-making.

## Project Topic: Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)
## Project Overview
This project involves creating a Sales Performance Dashboard for a Mega Supermarket store to track and analyze key sales metrics. Using Power BI, I transformed raw data into visual insights, highlighting total revenue, monthly sales trends, top-selling products, and underperforming categories. The dashboard features interactive filters for location, product category, and time, enabling deeper analysis and data-driven decisions. Developed during my Data Analysis Certified Certificate Course at The Incubator Hub, Lagos, the project showcases my ability to use data visualization and business intelligence tools to support strategic retail operations.
